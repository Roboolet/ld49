### Ludemdare 49
We made this game for the Ludemdare 49 gamejam in 3 days. The theme of Ludemdare 49 was *Unstable* so our minds were directed to an unstable solarsystem. This is the game we made in those 3 days and in the end we finished 39th out of the 2204 total submisions.

### Concept
An asteroid with a passion for destruction, touring the skies and knocking out every planetary body out of their stable orbits, and sending them careening through the galaxy, or letting them be swallowed by their host star.
